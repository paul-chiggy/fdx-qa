# Assessment Solution

This is a test QA assignment for Fedex performed with the Cypress IO test framework and TypeScript.

To install this project, run `npm install`

To run tests execute the following command: `npm run test`

### Improvements to that I'd like to make if I had more time:

- revise and add more proper selectors
- add a CI/CD yaml to hook it up to a pipeline
- dockerize this solution to make it platform-agnostic
- improve reporting by adding more reporting types
- extend the POM for better suiting the needs
- add a visual testing plugin to be able to compare screenshots
- add a linter and agree on common conventions
